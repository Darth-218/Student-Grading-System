# Project Code Standards

## Class Headers

Each class should have a header that contains:
1. The name of the class.
2. What the class represents.
3. Class methods overview.
5. The author of the module.

## Naming Conventions

7. Local Variables: Snake case or Flat case (i.e. `variable_name`, `variablename`)
8. Global Variables: Pascal snake case (i.e. `Global_Variable`)
9. Constants: Capital letters only (i.e. `CONSTANT`)
10. Functions: Camel case (i.e. `functionName`)
11. Classes: Pascal case (i.e. `ClassName`)

*Avoid including digits as much as possible.*

## Code Format

1. Indentation size: 2 space.
2. Braces: Open brace on the same line as the control statement.
